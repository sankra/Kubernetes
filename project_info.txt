🚀 Kubernetes Concepts – Hands-on Project
📌 Project Overview
This project provides a hands-on, practical guide to learning and working with Kubernetes, the most popular container orchestration platform. It includes well-documented examples and YAML configuration files that demonstrate how key Kubernetes components work together to manage containerized applications at scale.

Whether you're just starting with Kubernetes or want a reference project to brush up your concepts, this repository is structured to offer clarity and real-world usage patterns.


🎯 Key Concepts Covered
✅ Pods – Understanding the basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes.

✅ ReplicaSets – Ensuring a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.

✅ Deployments – Managing stateless application rollouts and rollbacks.

✅ Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) – Exposing applications within or outside the cluster.

✅ ConfigMaps & Secrets – Injecting external configuration and sensitive data into containers.

✅ Volumes & PersistentVolumes – Managing container storage needs.

✅ Namespaces – Organizing resources and isolating environments.

✅ Resource Limits & Requests – Controlling CPU and memory usage.

✅ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) – Scaling pods based on metrics like CPU utilization.

✅ kubectl Commands – Practical CLI examples for creating, viewing, and managing resources.
